    # Calculator by Michael Kane For Advanced Security lab 1
    
The purpose of this code is to "Write a simple four functions calculator (addition, subtraction, division and
multiplication) using Java programming language (Note: you can use any programming
language provided you will use the same for the duration of the module) which can be
used to perform arithmetic. The calculator must have Graphical User Interface. Make
sure that your program is well documented."

Currently the program is able to add, subtract, divide and multiple. It can also use decimal places.

I am currently working on implementing error checking for division by 0,
and the addition of a clear button and exit Button.

I have printed documents explaining how to create a GUI but I have no reference for them.
